# POSTS

I always felt I could never write a blog post cause they seemed so professional and all were filled with so much content that I felt all blog posts were only written by experts in that field.

But since I couldn't create a blog cause of my lazinessssss, I tried writing blog posts and stacking them up on Github.

At commiting this, I've only made a single blog post on [Dev Community](dev.to)

wish me Goodluck
